   AuthZEN Request/Response Profile for OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization
                                Requests
                draft-brossard-oauth-rar-authzen-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines a profile of OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization
   Requests leveraging the OpenID AuthZEN authorization request/response
   formats within the authorization_details JSON object.  Authorization
   servers and resource servers from different vendors can leverage this
   profile to request and receive relevant authorization decisions from
   an AuthZEN-compatible PDP in an interoperable manner.

1.  Introduction

   OpenID AuthZEN is a Working Group under the OpenID Foundation which
   aims to increase interoperability and standardization in the
   authorization realm.  In particular, AuthZEN aims to: - build
   standards-based authorization APIs - define standard design patterns
   for authorization - produce educational material to help raise
   awareness of externalized authorization.

   The aim of this profile is to define an AuthZEN-conformant profile of
   the OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests [RFC9396].  [RFC9396]
   introduces a new parameter authorization_details that allows clients
   to specify their fine-grained authorization requirements using the
   expressiveness of JSON [RFC8259] data structures.

   This specification introduces a more structured format for the
   authorization_details parameter.  The new format is also JSON
   [RFC8259] as a result of which this specification is conformant with
   [RFC9396] and is merely a stricter profile.

   For example the authorization request for a credit transfer mentioned
   in [RFC9396] would now be structured as follows

   {
       "subject": {
           "type": "user",
           "id": "Alice"
       },
       "resource": {
           "type": "payment_initiation",
           "id": "123",
           "recipient": {
               "creditorName": "Merchant A",
               "creditorAccount": {
                   "bic": "ABCIDEFFXXX",
                   "iban": "DE02100100109307118603"
               }
           }
       },
       "action": {
           "name": "transfer",
           "instructedAmount": {
               "currency": "EUR",
               "amount": "123.50"
           }
       },
       "context": {
           "remittance": "Ref Number Merchant"
       }
   }

                   Figure 1: Source Authorization Request

   Using AuthZEN as a format for authorization_details will increase the
   usability and the interoperability of [RFC9396].  In particular, it
   will be possible for the AS to forward the contents of the
   authorization_details parameter to an AuthZEN-conformant Policy
   Decision Point (PDP).

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the terms "access token", "refresh token",
   "authorization server" (AS), "resource server" (RS), "authorization
   endpoint", "authorization request", "authorization response", "token
   endpoint", "grant type", "access token request", "access token
   response", and "client" defined by "The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
   Framework" [RFC6749].  This specification uses the terms "PDP" and
   "PEP" defined by [ABAC] and [XACML].

3.  Request Parameter "authorization_details"

   In [RFC9396], the request parameter authorization_details contains,
   in JSON notation, an array of objects.  Each JSON object contains the
   data to specify the authorization requirements for a certain type of
   resource.  This specification defines the format for each one of
   these objects such that it conforms to [AUTHZEN] and [RFC9396].

   [AUTHZEN] groups JSON datastructures into 4 JSON objects: - subject:
   A Subject is the user or robotic principal about whom the
   Authorization API is being invoked.  The Subject may be requesting
   access at the time the Authorization API is invoked. - resource: A
   Resource is the target of an access request.  It is a JSON
   ([RFC8259]) object that is constructed similar to a Subject entity. -
   action: An Action is the type of access that the requester intends to
   perform.  Action is a JSON ([RFC8259]) object that contains at least
   a name field. - context: The Context object is a set of attributes
   that represent environmental or contextual data about the request
   such as time of day.  It is a JSON ([RFC8259]) object.

   Note: the aforementioned is indicative only.  Always refer to
   [AUTHZEN] for the formal definition of each element.

3.1.  "authorization_details" Structure

   Because *type* is REQUIRED, the new _authorization_details_ structure
   is as follows:

   *  type: An identifier for the authorization details type as a
      string.  The value for this profile is "authzen_evaluation" or
      "authzen_evaluations", corresponding to the AuthZEN API being
      invoked.  The value is case-insensitive.  This field is REQUIRED.

   *  request: this field contains the entire AuthZEN-conformant
      authorization request.  This field is REQUIRED.

3.2.  Authorization Details Types

   This profile declares a new value for the _type_ field as stated in
   the previous section.  The value for this profile is "authzen".  This
   indicates there will be a field called _request_ and its value will
   be an AuthZEN-conformant authorization request.

   The "authzen" type also indicates that the authorization response
   should contain a _response_ field containing the authorization
   response matching the request or requests.  The _response_ field will
   be an AuthZEN-conformant authorization response (see below).

   AuthZEN also defines a _type_ field in the Subject and Resource
   categories.  This field is meant to describe the type of user and/or
   resource required.

3.3.  Common Data Fields

   No field other than type and authzen shall be allowed in
   authorization_details when the type is "authzen".  All other fields
   such as the ones mentioned in [RFC9396] shall be inserted inside the
   AuthZEN request in the relevant object (Subject, Resource, Action, or
   Context).

4.  Authorization Request

   Conformant to [RFC9396], the authorization_details authorization
   request parameter can be used to specify authorization requirements
   in all places where the scope parameter is used for the same purpose,
   examples include:

   *  authorization requests as specified in [RFC6749]

   *  device authorization requests as specified in [RFC8628]

   *  backchannel authentication requests as defined in [OID-CIBA]

   Parameter encoding follows the exact same rules as [RFC9396].

4.1.  Example (non-normative)

   {
     "type": "authzen",
     "request":
       {
           "subject": {
               "type": "user",
               "id": "Alice"
           },
           "resource": {
               "type": "payment_initiation",
               "id": "123",
               "recipient": {
                   "creditorName": "Merchant A",
                   "creditorAccount": {
                       "bic": "ABCIDEFFXXX",
                       "iban": "DE02100100109307118603"
                   }
               }
           },
           "action": {
               "name": "transfer",
               "instructedAmount": {
                   "currency": "EUR",
                   "amount": "123.50"
               }
           },
           "context": {
               "remittance": "Ref Number Merchant"
           }
       }
   }

                   Figure 2: Source Authorization Request

5.  Support for Multiple Authorization Requests

   [AUTHZEN] supports a profile that allows the expression of multiple
   authorization requests in a single JSON object.  As a result, this
   profile recommends the use of a single authorization_details object
   containing _boxcarred_ requests as described in [BOXCAR] when
   possible and the use of the authorization_details array otherwise.

5.1.  Example (non-normative)

   This example is based on the one in [RFC9396] under section 3.
   Authorization Request.

   [
     {
       "type": "authzen",
       "request":
       {
         "subject": {
           "id": "alice@acmecorp.com",
           "type": "user"
         },
         "resource":{
           "id": "123",
           "type": "account_information",
           "location": "https://example.com/accounts"
         },
         "evaluations": {
           "eval-1": {
             "action": {
               "name": "list_accounts"
             }
           },
           "eval-2": {
             "action": {
               "name": "read_balances"
             }
           },
           "eval-3": {
             "action": {
               "name": "read_transactions"
             }
           }
         }
       }
     },
     {
       "type": "authzen",
       "request":
       {
         "subject": {
           "id": "alice@acmecorp.com",
           "type": "user"
         },
         "resource":{
           "id": "123",
           "type": "payment_initiation",
           "location": "https://example.com/payments",
           "recipient": {
               "creditorName": "Merchant A",
               "creditorAccount": {
                   "bic": "ABCIDEFFXXX",
                   "iban": "NL02RABO2228161411"
               }
           }
         },
         "context":{
           "remittance": "Ref Number Merchant"
         },
         "evaluations": {
           "eval-1": {
             "action": {
               "name": "initiate",
               "instructedAmount": {
               "currency": "EUR",
               "amount": "123.50"
               }
             }
           },
           "eval-2": {
             "action": {
               "name": "status"
             }
           },
           "eval-3": {
             "action": {
               "name": "cancel"
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   ]

6.  Authorization Responses

   Whereas [RFC9396] doesn't specify any extensions for
   authorization_details responses, [AUTHZEN] standardizes the responses
   expected from the PDP.  An AuthZEN response is therefore expected for
   all AuthZEN requests.  This response can be used by authorization
   clients directly or by the AS during token creation.  In particular,
   authorization response can be used in conjunction with any user-
   consent flow.

   The new _authorization_details_ response structure is as follows:

   *  type: The value of this field is expected to be "authzen".  This
      field is *REQUIRED*.

   *  response: This field contains the entire AuthZEN-conformant
      authorization response.  This field is *REQUIRED*.

6.1.  Single-response Example (non-normative)

   [
     {
       "type": "authzen",
       "response": {
           "decision": true
       }
     }
   ]

                  Figure 3: Source Authorization Response

6.2.  Boxcarred-response Example (non-normative)

   Using responses as described in [BOXCAR], a response to the boxcarred
   example of the multi-authorization requests section above could be:

   [
     {
       "type": "authzen",
       "response": {
         "evaluations": {
           "eval-1": {
             "decision": true
           },
           "eval-2": {
             "decision": false,
             "context": {
               "reason": "resource not found"
             }
           },
           "eval-3": {
             "decision": false,
             "context": {
               "reason": "Subject is a viewer of the resource"
             }
           }
         }
       }
     },
     {
       "type": "authzen",
       "response": {
         "evaluations": {
           "eval-1": {
             "decision": true
           },
           "eval-2": {
             "decision": false,
           },
           "eval-3": {
             "decision": false,
               "context": {
                 "error": {
                   "status": 404,
                   "message": "Resource not found"
               }
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   ]
