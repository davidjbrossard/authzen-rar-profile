   AuthZEN Request/Response Profile for OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization
                                Requests
                draft-brossard-oauth-rar_authzen-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines a profile of OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization
   Requests leveraging the OpenID AuthZEN authorization request/response
   formats within the authorization_details JSON object.  Authorization
   servers and resource servers from different vendors can leverage this
   profile to request and receive relevant authorization decisions from
   an AuthZEN-compatible PDP in an interoperable manner.
