   AuthZEN Request/Response Profile for OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization
                                Requests
                draft-brossard-oauth-rar_authzen-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines a profile of OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization
   Requests leveraging the OpenID AuthZEN authorization request/response
   formats within the authorization_details JSON object.  Authorization
   servers and resource servers from different vendors can leverage this
   profile to request and receive relevant authorization decisions from
   an AuthZEN-compatible PDP in an interoperable manner.

1.  Introduction

   OpenID AuthZEN is a Working Group under the OpenID Foundation which
   aims to increase interoperability and standardization in the
   authorization realm.  In particular, AuthZEN aims to: - build
   standards-based authorization APIs - define standard design patterns
   for authorization - produce educational material to help raise
   awareness of externalized authorization.

   The aim of this profile is to define an AuthZEN-conformant profile of
   the OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests [RFC9396].  [RFC9396]
   introduces a new parameter authorization_details that allows clients
   to specify their fine-grained authorization requirements using the
   expressiveness of JSON [RFC8259] data structures.

   This specification introduces a more structured format for the
   authorization_details parameter.  The new format is also JSON
   [RFC8259] as a result of which this specification is conformant with
   [RFC9396] and is merely a stricter profile.

   For example the authorization request for a credit transfer mentioned
   in [RFC9396] would now be structured as follows

   <CODE BEGINS>
   {
       "subject": {
           "type": "user",
           "id": "Alice"
       },
       "resource": {
           "type": "payment_initiation",
           "id": "123",
           "recipient": {
               "creditorName": "Merchant A",
               "creditorAccount": {
                   "bic": "ABCIDEFFXXX",
                   "iban": "DE02100100109307118603"
               }
           }
       },
       "action": {
           "name": "transfer",
           "instructedAmount": {
               "currency": "EUR",
               "amount": "123.50"
           }
       },
       "context": {
           "remittanceInformationUnstructured": "Ref Number Merchant"
       }
   }
   <CODE ENDS>

                   Figure 1: Source Authorization Request

   Using AuthZEN as a format for authorization_details will increase the
   usability and the interoperability of [RFC9396].  In particular, it
   will be possible for the AS to forward the contents of the
   authorization_details parameter to an AuthZEN-conformant PDP.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the terms "access token", "refresh token",
   "authorization server" (AS), "resource server" (RS), "authorization
   endpoint", "authorization request", "authorization response", "token
   endpoint", "grant type", "access token request", "access token
   response", and "client" defined by "The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
   Framework" [RFC6749].  This specification uses the terms "PDP" and
   "PEP" defined by "eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML)
   Version 3.0" [XACML].

3.  Request Parameter "authorization_details"

4.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of [RFC9396], [RFC6749], [RFC7662], and
   [RFC8414] all apply.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
